# Barrier Around

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/barrier_around.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/barrier_around)

A Flutter package that creates a barrier around any widget, no matter where it is.

## What problem does it solve?

Sometimes we need to highlight or showcase a specific widget, that's an easy task if the widget is a direct child of a Stack, but what if we want to create a barrier around a specific widget, which is inside, for example, a Column. We can try to calculate positions and sizes, but that can get really messy, really fast.

## Usage

To use this plugin, add `barrier_around` as a [dependency in your pubspec.yaml file](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/platform-integration/platform-channels).

### Example

Create a GlobalKey in order to identify which widget you want to create the barrier around.

```dart
final GlobalKey _barrierKey = GlobalKey();
```

Wrap the widget you want to create the barrier around, and wrap it with a `BarrierAround` widget.

Assign the GlobalKey to the `BarrierAround` widget.

```dart
BarrierAround(
    key: _barrierKey,
    child: yourWidget
)
```

Whenever you want to show the barrier, just call:

```dart
BarrierAroundManager.showBarrier(_barrierKey);
```

To dismiss the barrier, just tap on it, this behavior is enabled by default. If you want the barrier to not dismiss on tap, you can set `dismissOnBarrierTap` to `false` in the `BarrierAround` widget.

If you want to dismiss the barrier from other place, just call:

```dart
BarrierAroundManager.dismissBarrier(_barrierKey);
```
